# You might not need a framework

## What is this?

**I've been building management tools for businesses for 6 years.  
But no full-stack framework has truly convinced me.  
So I'm going to try something different.**

Building a back-office web application is unique:  

- A single public page (login), with all others requiring authentication  
- Complex logic, both on the frontend and backend  
- Authentication often uses SSO systems  
- Strict restrictions, e.g., no access allowed outside the company network (no npm, no GitHub)  
- Strict requirements, like: "Edge browser only, nothing else on the user's PC"  
- The app is loaded in the morning and cached for the rest of the day/week  
- A few hundred to a few thousand users max  
- Interactions with office tools (e.g., Excel import/export) or older lecacy apps  
- Reliability, integrity, security are critical â€” but great UX is also a must.  

I've deployed enterprise apps using various stacks:  
Django, NestJS, Express, Rails, Next, Remix, GraphQL, react-router, tRPC.  

**But the conclusion is clear:**  
When I need to build a backoffice web app, no framework stands out as the "obvious" choice.  

What I want is simple:  

- A single Page App (SPA) and its backend
- Same language for frontend and backend to obfustate the network  
- Minimal dependencies  
- Use React to make it easy to build a great UI
- Everything must be *very* easy to test  
- Strong typing with cohesion between frontend and backend
- Simplicity and speed  
- Deliver the app as a single zipped package, executable on a Linux or Windows server with Node and Postgres installed 
- Fully usable with tools like Copilot/Cursor/etc. (leveraging a massive pre-installed codebase)  

So, I'll explore a more minimalist stack.  
Leaning on core building blocks (Node, Vite, React, and even plain HTML/CSS), whose progress sometimes makes extra libraries unnecessary.

## Let's build a backoffice web app

Let's start with the frontend.

The app will have a login page, and a dashboard page.
The dashboard page is protected by authentication.
The login page will be a simple form, and the dashboard page will display a list of users.

The very first test should be as simple as possible:

```ts
it("A registered user can log in", async () => {
  const { auth, router, notification } = makeStore(testApi);
  expect(router.currentPage).toBe("/login");
  await auth.login({ email: "john.doe@acme.com", password: "pwd" });
  expect(notification.toast).toEqual({
    message: "Welcome John !",
    type: "success",
  });
  expect(router.currentPage).toBe("/dashboard");
});
```

To make it passed, we just need 3 classes and a factory to instantiate them.

```ts
export function makeStore(api: API) {
  const router = new Router();
  const notification = new Notification();
  const auth = new Authentication(api, { router, notification });
  return { auth, router, notification };
}
```

The `api` inject the way to communicate with the server.
- When we are testing, the API makes direct calls to the server functions.
- When we are running the app, the API provides a type-safe RPC to the server.
